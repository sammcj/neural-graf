  - [ ] Document API endpoints

- [x] **Main Application**
  - [x] Implement application entry point (cmd/server/main.go)
  - [x] Set up graceful shutdown handling
  - [x] Configure logging and monitoring

### Phase 5: Enhancements and Future Features

## Implementation Progress

### Completed Work (as of April 8, 2025)

We have successfully implemented the core components of the MCP-Graph project:

1. **Project Structure and Configuration**
   - Created a modular Go project structure
   - Implemented configuration management using Viper
   - Set up environment variable and YAML configuration

2. **Graph Interface and Dgraph Implementation**
   - Defined a clean graph store interface
   - Implemented the interface using Dgraph
   - Added support for nodes, edges, queries, and schema management

3. **MCP Server Integration**
   - Integrated with the Model Context Protocol using mark3labs/mcp-go
   - Implemented tools for graph operations
   - Added support for both stdio and SSE server modes
   - Created an MCP client configuration for use with Cline/Claude Desktop

4. **Containerisation**
   - Created a multi-stage Dockerfile for efficient builds
   - Set up docker-compose with Dgraph services
   - Configured networking and volumes

### Next Steps

The next phase of development should focus on:

1. **API Layer Development**
   - Implementing a RESTful API for non-MCP clients
   - Adding authentication and authorization

2. **Testing**
   - Writing unit tests for the Dgraph implementation
   - Adding integration tests for the MCP server

3. **Future Enhancements**
   - Developing a lightweight visual graph explorer
   - Adding import/export functionality
   - Implementing performance optimisations

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to building the mcp-graph system, with each phase building upon the previous ones. As we complete each phase, we'll update this checklist to track our progress.
