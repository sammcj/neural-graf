# MCP-Graph Implementation Plan

This document outlines the phased implementation plan for the mcp-graph project. The plan is structured to ensure we build the system incrementally, focusing on manageable chunks of work while maximising efficiency when creating or editing files.

## Implementation Checklist

  - [ ] Create initial README.md with project description

- [ ] **Configuration Management**
  - [ ] Create configuration structures in internal/config
  - [ ] Implement configuration loading from file and environment variables
  - [ ] Create .env.example file with template variables
  - [ ] Create config.yaml example

- [ ] **Core Graph Interface**
  - [ ] Define and implement the graph store interface (internal/graph/graph.go)
  - [ ] Create basic models for nodes and edges

### Phase 2: Dgraph Integration

- [ ] **Dgraph Implementation**
  - [ ] Set up Dgraph client with connection handling
  - [ ] Implement graph store interface methods for Dgraph
  - [ ] Create schema management functionality
  - [ ] Implement query functionality
  - [ ] Add transaction support
  - [ ] Write unit tests for Dgraph implementation

- [ ] **Docker Integration**
  - [ ] Create Dockerfile for the application
  - [ ] Create docker-compose.yml with Dgraph service

### Phase 3: MCP Server Integration

- [ ] **MCP Server Setup**
  - [ ] Implement MCP server with mcp-go
  - [ ] Create tool definitions
  - [ ] Implement tool handlers
  - [ ] Add resource capabilities

- [ ] **Knowledge Graph Tools**
  - [ ] Create query tool for graph access
  - [ ] Add document creation and management tools
  - [ ] Write unit tests for MCP tools

- [ ] **Server Modes**
  - [ ] Implement stdio server mode
  - [ ] Add SSE server mode
  - [ ] Create MCP client configuration example

### Phase 4: API Layer and Service Implementation

- [ ] **Core Service Layer**
  - [ ] Implement knowledge manager service (internal/service)
  - [ ] Create service interfaces for business logic
  - [ ] Implement data validation and processing logic

- [ ] **API Development**
  - [ ] Set up HTTP server in cmd/server
  - [ ] Implement API handlers for CRUD operations
  - [ ] Create middleware for authentication and logging
  - [ ] Implement error handling
  - [ ] Document API endpoints

- [ ] **Main Application**
  - [ ] Implement application entry point (cmd/server/main.go)
  - [ ] Set up graceful shutdown handling
  - [ ] Configure logging and monitoring

### Phase 5: Enhancements and Future Features

- [ ] **Visual Graph Explorer**
  - [ ] Research visualisation libraries
  - [ ] Implement basic graph visualisation API
  - [ ] Create web interface for graph exploration

- [ ] **Import/Export Functionality**
  - [ ] Implement data export to JSON/CSV
  - [ ] Add import capabilities from various sources
  - [ ] Create migration utilities

- [ ] **Performance Optimisations**
  - [ ] Implement caching mechanisms
  - [ ] Add connection pooling
  - [ ] Optimise query performance

### Phase 6: Documentation and Testing

- [ ] **Documentation**
  - [ ] Complete README with setup and usage instructions
  - [ ] Create API documentation
  - [ ] Add code examples
  - [ ] Document configuration options

- [ ] **Testing**
  - [ ] Write integration tests
  - [ ] Create benchmarks
  - [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
  - [ ] Perform security testing

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to building the mcp-graph system, with each phase building upon the previous ones. As we complete each phase, we'll update this checklist to track our progress.
