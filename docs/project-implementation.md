# MCP-Graph Implementation Plan

This document outlines the phased implementation plan for the mcp-graph project. The plan is structured to ensure we build the system incrementally, focusing on manageable chunks of work while maximising efficiency when creating or editing files.

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to building the mcp-graph system, with each phase building upon the previous ones. The plan is designed to be flexible, allowing for the optional components to be implemented or skipped as needed. As we complete each phase, we'll update this checklist to track our progress.
