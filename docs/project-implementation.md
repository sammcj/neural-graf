## Implementation Progress

### Completed Work (as of April 8, 2025)

We have successfully implemented the core components of the MCP-Graph project:

1. **Project Structure and Configuration**
   - Created a modular Go project structure
   - Implemented configuration management using Viper
   - Set up environment variable and YAML configuration

2. **Graph Interface and Dgraph Implementation**
   - Defined a clean graph store interface
   - Implemented the interface using Dgraph
   - Added support for nodes, edges, queries, and schema management

3. **MCP Server Integration**
   - Integrated with the Model Context Protocol using mark3labs/mcp-go
   - Implemented tools for graph operations
   - Added support for both stdio and SSE server modes
   - Created an MCP client configuration for use with Cline/Claude Desktop

4. **Containerisation**
   - Created a multi-stage Dockerfile for efficient builds
   - Set up docker-compose with Dgraph services
   - Configured networking and volumes

### Next Steps

The next phase of development should focus on:

1. **API Layer Development**
   - Implementing a RESTful API for non-MCP clients
   - Adding authentication and authorization

2. **Testing**
   - Writing unit tests for the Dgraph implementation
   - Writing unit tests for the service layer
   - Adding integration tests for the MCP server

3. **Future Enhancements**
   - Developing a lightweight visual graph explorer, but we need to make sure we don't end up adding a big bloated javascript ecosystem to the project
   - Adding import/export functionality
   - Implementing performance optimisations

### Recent Progress (April 8, 2025)

We have completed Phase 4 of the implementation plan, focusing on the service layer and API implementation:

1. **Knowledge Manager Service**
   - Created a service interface with high-level operations for managing the knowledge graph
   - Implemented document operations (create, get, update, delete, search)
   - Implemented concept operations (create, get, link, search)
   - Added schema initialisation functionality

2. **MCP Server Enhancement**
   - Updated the MCP server to use the service layer
   - Added new tools for document and concept management
   - Maintained backward compatibility with existing tools

3. **RESTful API Implementation**
   - Created a RESTful API server using gorilla/mux
   - Implemented document endpoints (create, get, update, delete, search)
   - Implemented concept endpoints (create, get, link, search)
   - Added query and schema endpoints
   - Implemented logging and error handling middleware
   - Integrated the API server with the main application
   - Created comprehensive API documentation in docs/api.md

4. **Project Architecture**
   - The project now has a clean, modular architecture:
     - **Graph Interface**: Defines the core operations for the knowledge graph
     - **Dgraph Implementation**: Implements the graph interface using Dgraph
     - **Service Layer**: Provides high-level business logic and domain operations
     - **MCP Server**: Exposes the knowledge graph via the Model Context Protocol
     - **API Server**: Provides a RESTful API for non-MCP clients

### Running the Application

The system can be run using the following command:

```bash
go run cmd/server/main.go
```

This will start both the MCP server and the RESTful API server, allowing clients to interact with the knowledge graph through either interface.

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to building the mcp-graph system, with each phase building upon the previous ones. As we complete each phase, we'll update this checklist to track our progress.
